Custom re-usable functions
===========

These are my custom functions, nothing to do with cake php but everything to do with my custom KupcakeCMS (MVC based CMS).

Simple CMS using Bootstrap frontend


I used to have a CodeIgniter bootstrap framework that dealt with basic CRUD stuff, news articles, image galleries, users, permissions etc. All based on the amazing kupcakeCMS framework.

Feature Overview

News Articles (with image uploads)
User Management
Role Management
Help and Support (sends an email from a form in the backend)
Gallery and Images
Setup Of Database and User Automatic
Setting Up The Database


Things in here are unfinished and a lot of it is undocumented. I've done most of what I can and there will be lots of bugs. This is just a starting point for what I'm hoping will turn into a nice bootstrap for plonking into a new client's website or even your own.
More files will be uploaded when i get the time.
